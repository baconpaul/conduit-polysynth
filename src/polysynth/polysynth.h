/*
 * ConduitPolysynth is the core synthesizer class. It uses the clap-helpers C++ plugin extensions
 * to present the CLAP C API as a C++ object model.
 *
 * The core features here are
 *
 * - Hold the CLAP description static object
 * - Advertise parameters and ports
 * - Provide an event handler which responds to events and returns sound
 * - Do voice management. Which is really not very sophisticated (it's just an array of 64
 *   voice objects and we choose the next free one, and if you ask for a 65th voice, nothing
 *   happens).
 * - Provide the API points to delegate UI creation to a separate editor object,
 *   coded in clap-saw-demo-editor
 *
 * This demo is coded to be relatively familiar and close to programming styles form other
 * formats where the editor and synth collaborate closely; as described in clap-saw-demo-editor
 * this object also holds the two queues the editor and synth use to communicate; and holds the
 * bundle of atomic values to which the editor holds a const &.
