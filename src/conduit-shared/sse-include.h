 * Roughly, that means you are welcome to copy the code and
 * ideas in the src/ directory, but perhaps not code from elsewhere
 * if you are closed source or non-GPL3. And if you do copy this code
 * you will need to replace some of the dependencies. Please see
 * the discussion in README.md for further information on what this may
 * mean for you.
